        <h1>Issues regarding land disputes</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Economic Barriers - Indigenous economic development faces numerous
          barriers rooted in a historical legacy of colonialism and the failure
          to recognize Indigenous jurisdiction. Witnesses have highlighted the
          detrimental impacts of these factors on their communities and
          organizations. The replacement of Indigenous institutions with federal
          bureaucracy, loss of freedom, and dependency on government programs
          have hindered their economic progress. Stripped of fiscal powers and
          land, Indigenous peoples have been deprived of essential resources
          necessary for economic growth, such as access to capital,
          infrastructure, and capacity building. Moreover, the conflicting
          responsibilities faced by federal public servants and the government,
          torn between respecting their fiduciary duty to Indigenous peoples and
          protecting the Crown, create further challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Indigenous communities often find themselves excluded from the
          decision-making process, resulting in a lack of involvement in
          strategic planning and economic recovery initiatives. The United
          Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) has
          been identified as a vital instrument in rectifying this issue,
          emphasizing the need for free, prior, and informed consent to ensure
          certainty in decision-making processes. However, Indigenous voices are
          sometimes disregarded, with input provided during resource development
          discussions ultimately being ignored. Colonial laws and policies,
          along with the failure to acknowledge Indigenous jurisdiction,
          perpetuate these limitations, further obstructing opportunities for
          Indigenous participation in economic development. Therefore, the full
          implementation of UNDRIP holds crucial importance in fostering
          inclusive and equitable economic growth for Indigenous communities. To
          overcome these barriers, it is essential for the Government of Canada
          to recognize and support the innovative solutions developed by
          Indigenous peoples, empowering them to drive their economic progress.

        <h3>Land Management – Services Canada is offering to help</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          the First Nations Fiscal Management Act (FNFMA) and the First Nations
          Land Management Act (FNLMA), which offer participating First Nations
          the opportunity to partially liberate themselves from the constraints
          of the Indian Act concerning fiscal and land management matters.
          However, the committee also learned about certain limitations within
          the FMFNA regime. Financial institutions are still hesitant to provide
          funding to First Nations, even when they adhere to the Act, leaving
          the First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA) as the sole institution
          willing to grant loans. Nonetheless, the FNFA has reached its capacity
          under the current model, highlighting the need to explore ways to
          collaborate with the federal government and boost infrastructure and
          economic investment in First Nations communities.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Furthermore, the committee heard about the crucial need to ensure that
          the three First Nations financial institutions have adequate resources
          to fulfill their mandates effectively. This was identified as a
          significant issue at the inception of this legislation, and it remains
          a critical aspect to address now. On a related note, the FNLMA,
          enacted in 1999, has established an opt-in regime enabling
          participating First Nations to replace Indian Act land provisions with
          their own land codes. This move has led to more certainty in land
          tenure, reduced transaction costs, and expanded financing options for
          various projects related to infrastructure, housing, and economic
          development. Despite these advancements, the Indian Act continues to
          serve as a significant barrier to economic development for First
          Nations. The First Nations Lands Advisory Board highlighted several
          hindrances, including poor land certainty, a substandard land registry
          system lacking formal regulation, complex policies, slow
          decision-making processes, insufficient environmental and land
          protection on reserves, and inadequate critical infrastructure
          investments. As a result, addressing the persistent challenges of the
          Indian Act remains paramount in promoting sustainable economic
          development for Indigenous communities.
