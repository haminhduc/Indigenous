          Land is an important part of Indigenous People’s lives since it is one
          of the sources of living and is connected to their spiritual beliefs,
          their traditional teachings and knowledge so it is a key to sustaining
          the culture for current and future generations of Indigenous People.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          For the longest time, Indigenous land rights have been fortified
          through a lot of legal battles and administrative developments aimed
          at tackling concerns like the expansion of the land base. However,
          it's important to note that Indigenous rights frameworks are still far
          from being fully resolved and continue to be one of the most intensely
          debated political matters of today.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Until today, not all Indigenous groups has guaranteed the right to
          land. Indians with no status are not recognized as reserve members
          and, as a result, cannot lay claim to lands. Métis, one of the three
          recognized Indigenous peoples of Canada, the legitimacy of land
          rights' existence continues to be a subject of dispute.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Treaty renegotiation takes place in Canada today. Other groups are
          currently negotiating treaties for the first time – more than 70 are
          under negotiation as of September 2019. Furthermore, when land rights
          are defined, it remains to be decided on a case-by-case basis whether
          development projects can take place or not. The extent to which
          Indigenous peoples have the right to be consulted about or to veto
          projects in their traditional territories is disputed.

          The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called on the Canadian
          government to use both the Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of 1764
          as references to come up with the creation of a Royal Proclamation of
          Reconciliation that will be issued by the crown.

            Repudiate concepts used to justify European sovereignty over
            Indigenous lands and peoples such as the Doctrine of Discovery and
            terra nullius.

          <li>
            Adopt and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of

            maintaining those relationships into the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reconcile Aboriginal and Crown constitutional and legal orders to
            ensure that Aboriginal peoples are full partners in Confederation,
            including the recognition and integration of Indigenous laws and
            legal traditions in negotiation and implementation processes
            involving Treaties, land claims, and other constructive agreements.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Indigenous peoples in Canada rightfully maintain custodianship of
          their ancestral lands, due to their historical occupation and
          adherence to customary law. Treaties should be respected accordingly
          and reevaluated as necessary. With this proclamation, it will be able
          to reinstate the relationship between Indigenous People and the Crown
          and would consider as two nations of the land and both will have
          rights to sovereignty. Additionally, it will recognize that Indigenous
          Peoples were the original settlers on Turtle Island even before the
          Europeans came and settled also this contradicts the Doctrine of
          Discovery and the concept of Terra Nullius.

          Effects of Colonialism to Indigenous Land Rights
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Colonialism made a massive negative effect and led to Indigenous
          Peoples' economic dependence and relative deprivation. Indigenous
          peoples have undergone a history of dispossession, facing forced
          displacement from their ancestral lands to make way for the expansion
          of settlement for the Europeans. The implementation of land allocation
          policies, such as the creation of reserves and the restriction of
          Indigenous peoples to isolated territories, has been a key factor in
          maintaining this situation. Indigenous Peoples were often put in Less
          advantageous areas with lower-quality land for agricultural and trade
          purposes which are far from the society or most populated areas.

          Treaty negotiations have been done historically and some are still
          under ongoing process. Most treaties recognize land rights. Making a
          treaty is an essential process of acknowledging formal land ownership
          rights for Indigenous Peoples. The Canadian government have signed
          agreements with different Indigenous groups between the years of 1701
          and 1923 which are called historic treaties. Indigenous groups may opt
          to pursue legal claims or engage in negotiations for specific land
          claims if the government has failed to fulfill its obligations or
          adequately implement treaties.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Currently, numerous Indigenous groups are currently engaging in their
          first-ever treaty negotiations which have been signed since 1973. This
          shows the ongoing and unresolved nature of this issue.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Comprehensive Land Claims Policy was accepted by the Canadian
          Government in 1973 and updated last 1986. This allows the Indigenous
          groups to negotiate agreements with the Canadian government. These
          agreements are called modern treaties which include the discussion
          about the transfer of land ownership, management of land, water,
          heritage, environment, and wildlife, financial compensation,
          sovereignty agreement (since 1995), economic development strategy, and
          the sharing of resource revenue.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Since 1973, 26 comprehensive land claims have been signed and are in
          effect, whereas at least other 56 are being negotiated as of November
          of 2018. Some examples of treaties under negotiation are the Innu
          Nation Claim (Newfoundland and Labrador), Atikamekw Nation Council
          Comprehensive Land and Self-Government Claims (Quebec), Algonquins of
          Ontario (Ontario), and Inuit Transboundary Negotiations in Northern
          Manitoba (Manitoba).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Inherent Right Policy of 1995 helped the Indigenous People get
          their acknowledgement of the right to sovereignty, which says
          Indigenous People “have the right to govern themselves in relation to
          matters that are internal to their communities, integral to their
          unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions,
          and with respect to their special relationship to their land and their
          resources.” (First Nations Financial Management Board, 2018)
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          According to First Nations Financial Management Board, Canada has
          already finalized 32 modern agreements with aggregations of Inuit,
          Métis and First Nations, between comprehensive, stand-alone and
          sectoral self-government agreements and land claims (2018). Some of
          these modern agreements are Tla’amin Final Agreement in 2014, Eeyou
          Marine Region Land Claims Agreement (Quebec) in 2012, Nunavik Inuit
          Land Claims Agreement Quebec in 2008, Kwanlin Dun First Nation Final
          Agreement in 2005, Little Salmon / Carmacks First Nation Final
          Agreement in 1997., and many more.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Federal officials also have been coordinating with different
          Indigenous groups to negotiate and address their needs, rights, and
          interests which is called the “Recognition of Indigenous Rights and
          Self-Determination discussions”, which seeks to better address the
          needs and priorities identified by Indigenous communities and aim to
          bridge socio-economic disparities between Indigenous and
          non-Indigenous Canadians while promoting greater self-determination.
