          Indigenous comprehensive/specific land claims, ongoing negotiations

        <p class="paragraph">
          Indigenous Peoples have suffered from policies, suppression, abuse and
          have been deprived of basic human rights by the Canadian government
          for far too long. The Doctrine of Discovery issued by Pope Nicholas V
          in 1452, promoted the conquest, colonization and exploitation of
          Indigenous Peoples and their land. Pope Francis’ statement rescinding
          the Doctrine of Discovery could have significant implications for the
          land claim process and private property laws that have been predicated
          on this unjust assumption of ownership. The historical legal principle
          has been used by European “powers” to justify their colonization and
          appropriation of lands belonging to Indigenous peoples around the
          world. By repudiating the doctrine, it is likely that there will be a
          shift in how land claims and ownership are perceived, especially
          concerning Indigenous lands.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery could “bolster”
          Indigenous peoples' claims to access their traditional hunting grounds
          and land income. It could provide a legal framework to challenge the
          fossil-fuel development and logging that have been detrimental to
          Indigenous peoples’ livelihoods, cultural heritage and access to
          resources. In April 2023, “officials with both the fed­­eral and
          British Columbia governments admitted successive administrations had
          broken their promises to the Blueberry River First Nations, the Doig
          River First Nation, the Halfway River First Nation, the Saulteau First
          Nations and the West Moberly First Nations.” Regarding the specific
          case of First Nations in Canada who “signed Treaty 8 in 1899, which
          promised them access to their traditional hunting grounds and the
          ability to generate income from the land. But a protracted refusal by
          the province and the federal government to make good on the agreement
          forced the nations to spend more than two decades battling for
          compensation.” Loss of income, no access to traditional hunting
          grounds; the province had allowed “fossil-fuel development in the
          region which had prevented the nation from being able to live off the
          land.” The rejection of the Doctrine of Discovery could shift the
          perspective on resource extraction projects on Indigenous lands. It
          may prompt governments and corporations to reassess the impact of such
          projects on Indigenous communities, their traditional territories and
          the environment.

          Residential schools meant to limit and eventually erase Indigenous
          culture, traditions, teachings, and beliefs created by the Canadian
          government with the help of Christian churches caused irreversible
          generational trauma. Children being removed from their homes and taken
          away from their parents resulted in their lost sense of belonging.
          While dealing with the confusion and lack of understanding, Indigenous
          children were ill-treated, disrespected, emotionally, physically and
          sexually abused and killed just for being who they are. “The
          government’s goal was to erase Indigenous Peoples and the easiest way
          for them to do so was mass genocide. They believed Indigenous peoples
          as ignorant, savages, a burden to society, and in need of guidance on
          the “right way to live”.” Children were not allowed to nurture, or
          care of parents and families; in turn, they did not learn parenting
          skills needed to care for and nurture their own children. Abuse
          learned at young ages in residential schools became parents’ methods
          in raising their own children. These horrific organizations and
          actions by people who disregarded any decency towards other human
          beings caused lasting effects as children are now adults, parents, and
          grandparents. As a result of their treatment, many Indigenous could
          not deal with the trauma which caused them to end their lives.
          Indigenous people have a higher suicide rate than other Canadians,
          especially women. “Some communities experience what has been called
          suicide epidemics.”

        <p class="paragraph">
          Residential schools and their impacts, the repudiation of the Doctrine
          of Discovery may serve as a symbolic acknowledgment of the injustices
          perpetrated against Indigenous peoples. However, this single act is
          nowhere close to enough to undo the lasting impacts of residential
          schools. Comprehensive efforts, including reparations truth and
          reconciliation processes and support for healing and restoration, are
          necessary to address and repair the intergenerational trauma and
          cultural suppression caused by such policies.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery could have a
          transformative effect on how Indigenous Peoples and their land rights
          are recognized and respected, but it must be complemented by concrete
          actions and policy changes to bring meaningful improvements in the
          lives of Indigenous communities.
